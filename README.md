<h3>About Project</h3>
<p>While learning Data Structure and Algorithm in my second year i find sorting algorithms interesting and the way people explain it using different way , like using cards with number or cups labelled with number. This fascinated me to build something with react that i can see in real time, so after some research i found  i can for visualizer, and then i build this. </p>
